# GalacticComputers
It occurred to me that there was no integration between GalactiCraft and OpenComputers, so I've decided to make one myself. After all, you can barely call it a "space base" if it have no computers!

This is my very first mod and my first attempt of writing in Java, so I'm very sorry for oddities all around.

## How can I control supported block?

You'll need to use adapter from OpenComputers to do so. Somewhat annoying, but that's it.

## What mods are supported?

* Galacticraft Core
* Galacticraft Planets
* GalaxySpace

All mods with exception of Galacticraft Core are optional.

### Can you add support for [Galacticraft addon not listed above]?

Probably so. If it have some machinery that could be operated by computers, feel free to open an issue!

## New blocks and items

Currently, only Sealable Cable Block is added. It acts like other sealable blocks from GalactiCraft do, so you can connect computers inside and outside your space base without air leaks.
